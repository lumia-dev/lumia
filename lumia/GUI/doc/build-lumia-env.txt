==========================
Installing LumiaGUI (and LumiaDA - the branch of Lumia with Direct Access to th carbon portal built-in)

I'm on a ubuntu 22.04  system - you may have to adjust to your environment. Lumia is unlikely to run on Microsoft operating systems,
but pretty much any Linux flavour should be fine.

Let's focus on LumiaGUI for now. For Lumia itself you needa a truckload of input data, which is why
we prefer to run the actual inversion model in Lund with direct access to ICOS data (observations & emissions) and the SWESTORE (footprints, ERA5).

1) prepare your system

    # update the package repository
sudo apt update
    # we need a gcc and gfortran compiler
sudo apt install build-essential gcc gfortran gfortran-12 libgfortran-12-dev libgfortran5
    # we need libraries to read hdf4/5, netcdf, hdf4/5 and grib (libeccodes) data formats as well as the apps cdo, ncdump + ncgen (netcdf-bin) and for convenience ncview
sudo apt install libgfortran5 libeccodes0 libeccodes-dev libsz2 libhdf5-103-1 libhdf5-hl-100 libnetcdf19 hdf5-helpers libhdf4-0 libhdf5-fortran-102 libhdf5-hl-fortran-100 libhdf5-cpp-103-1 libhdf5-hl-cpp-100 libhdf5-dev libnetcdf-dev libnetcdf-c++4 libnetcdff7 libnetcdff-dev netcdf-bin ncview libudunits2-0  libudunits2-data libudunits2-0 udunits-bin cdo
    # we need git
sudo apt install git git-man git-extras git-hub libgit2-1.1
    # this and likely 1 or 2 more  libs are needed for python tkinter to work (graphics package for Linux - not needed for Jupyter notebooks to run)
sudo apt install libtk8.6
    # we may need other things, but I am not sure until we test the image

2) Install a recent Miniconda, with Python 3.10 or 3.11, e.g.

# install Miniconda - disable any existing conda installations in this bash terminal, while we are building the docker image
export PYTHONPATH=''
export CONDA_PREFIX=''
Miniconda3-py311_24.4.0-0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -m -p /opt/condaPython3.11

source /opt/condaPython3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/conda/shell/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=/opt/condaPython3.11/envs

3) create a dedicated environment for LumiaGUI (and LumiaDA)
/opt/condaPython3.11/bin/conda create -y --name LumiaDA python=3.11

conda info --envs
conda activate LumiaDA
python --version    # sanity check
which python        # sanity check

add this to your .bashrc file:

export PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
export ACTIVE_ENV=LumiaDA
export CONDA_PREFIX=/opt/condaPython3.11
export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/envs

export ENV_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX/envs/$ACTIVE_ENV
export PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin:$CONDA_PREFIX/condabin:$PATH
conda activate $ACTIVE_ENV

export PYTHONPATH=$ENV_PREFIX/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/:$ENV_PREFIX/bin:$ENV_PREFIX/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages:$ENV_PREFIX/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages/eric7/:$ENV_PREFIX/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages/eric7/DebugClients/Python/:$ENV_PREFIX/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages/eric7plugins/
export PYPTH=$ENV_PREFIX/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/:$ENV_PREFIX/bin:$ENV_PREFIX/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages

4) exit your bash terminal and start a fresh one so the updated .bashrc kicks in.

5) update pip and install all requirements for lumiaDA/lumiaGUI:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

pip install -r /home/arndt/nateko/it/bygg/docker.LumiaDA.01/min-requirements-lumiGUI.txt

Note: if you want a nice Python IDE, try  pip install eric-ide (however, this will likely install a number of other things and might be
better installed in an independent virt env of its own.)

The Latest versions of LumiaMaster (not LumiaDA) require 3 intel packages not available through pip. There are separate instructions available

6) installing LumiaDA and LumiaGUI

Find a good location where to install the package. The working directory may later be anywhere else

mkdir LumiaDA
cd LumiaDA
#      branch: LumiaDA
#      location: git@github.com:lumia-dev/lumia/commit/575cc93f95e84f2f84df0b565a6128de6772e54b
#      url: git@github.com:lumia-dev/lumia.git
git config --global init.defaultBranch master
git clone https://github.com/lumia-dev/lumia.git
cd lumia
git switch lumiaDA
pip install -e .

7) LumiaMaster has a python and a FORTRAN optimizer to choose from, lumiaDA has only the FORTRAN one that we need to build
However, this is not needed for lumiaGUI, only for lumia itself. For details see the lumia documentation.

cd src/congrad/
make
make install
# Make sure the gfortran build for congrad.exe was successful
ls -l congrad.exe

==========

Recommended reading to get the minimum requirements file for a locally installed home-built python package:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35796968/get-all-modules-packages-used-by-a-python-project
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs /home/project/location

creates requirements.txt
which you can then use with
pip install -r requirements.txt

=============================

Installing the LumiaGUI Notebook:

1) have a working version of JupyterLab - at Lund we are using
JupyterLab version 3.4.7 with Python 3.10.6

2) Create a working folder in JupyterLab and navigate to your lumiaDA installation directory.
In that folder create 2 subfolder, 'tmp' and 'output'

3) cd deeper into
./lumia/GUI/
and upload
lumiaGUInotebook.ipynb
lumia-config-v6-tr-co2.yml
*.py

All things fair and squre, you should be able to run
lumiaGUInotebook.ipynb
in your JupyterLab
You may want to uncomment the first few lines the first time you run it as you are likely to need those additional libraries.

Good Luck!
