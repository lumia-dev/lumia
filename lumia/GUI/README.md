# lumiaGui
Provides a graphical user interface for setting up the configuration file for LUMIA. This includes an interface to the ICOS carbon portal and the interactive selection of input data for LUMIA.

lumiaGUI is part of the https://github.com/lumia-dev/lumia/tree/LumiaDA project (or possibly also other branches of https://github.com/lumia-dev/). lumiaGUI mirrors only the GUI submodule
from its parent lumia-dev. It should never be ahead of it. In fact, lumiaGui was only created for convenience to share the code of the GUI submodule, which can exist quite happily without the main lumia application, which in itself has no graphical elements (pure terminal app).
