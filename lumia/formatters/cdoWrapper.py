This is a collection of wrapper scripts to call the Climate Data Operator (cdo) to achieve common
tasks on geolocated netcdf files.

ensureCorrectGrid() ensures that the netcdf file provided is on the user-provided lat/lon grid and if not
                                creates it and stores it in a predefined location for future use.
ensureReportedTimeIsStartOfMeasurmentInterval() checks whether the first time dimension value is one (undesired)
                             or zero (as it should). Normally the netcdf header should provide whether the times reported
                             refer to the start of the time step, the middle or the end. VPRM files do, EDGAR4.3 files don't.
                             Hence we cannot rely on the header info and we use a primitive and brutal approach with zero
                             elegance: if the first time step starts at one, then measurments are assumed to be reported at the
                             end of each time step, while Lumia expect this time to represent the beginning of the time interval.
                             Therefor we shift the time axis back in time by one timestep which is then equivalent to having
                             times representing the beginning of an observation period.

    interpolate the spatial coordinates in sExistingFile if necessary

    We trust the climate data operator software CDO from Max Planck Hamburg to do a decent job on interpolation - and it is easy to use
    CDO Homepaqe:  https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo
    First we need the reference grid onto which to map. For this we extract it from any existing ICOS flux file with the correct grid, e.g.
    cdo griddes flux_co2.VPRM.2018.nc >cdo-icos-quarter-degree.grid
    Then we call cdo with the conservative remapping command (see below and study the cdo user guide).
    We also double checked the output to make sure it was mapped correctly onto the provided grid.

        - if the resolution in sExistingFile is the desired one, then just return sExistingFile as the file name
        - use the existing matched grid file in case cdo has been called previously for the requested input file (see below) and return the name of that file
        - else call cdo to interpolate to the user requested lat/lon grid, save its output to a predetermined location and put the dLat-dLon into the file extension and hand that output file back
    @param sExistingFile an existing netcdf data file like a co2 flux file or other with a lat/lon grid that cdo understands
    @type string
    @param grid required parameter that defines the extent and spatial resolution of the lat/lon rectangle requested (defaults to None)
